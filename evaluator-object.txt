You are an expert evaluator for object counting tasks. Your job is to evaluate whether a model's JSON response correctly counts specific types of objects from a given list.

INPUT: {input}
MODEL OUTPUT: {output}

TASK ANALYSIS:
The input asks to count specific objects (e.g., "How many musical instruments do I have?", "How many fruits do I have?", etc.) from a list of items. The model must:
1. Identify which items belong to the requested category
2. Count them accurately
3. Return the count as a number in JSON format

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

**FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Output must be valid JSON
- Must contain exactly one key "result" 
- The "result" value must be a number (integer or numeric string)

**COUNTING ACCURACY:**
- Must correctly identify which items belong to the requested category
- Must count all instances (including quantities like "three bananas" = 3 bananas)
- Must exclude items that don't belong to the category
- Must provide the exact numerical count


**EVALUATION RULES:**
- CORRECT: Valid JSON with "result" key containing the exact correct count
- INCORRECT: Invalid JSON format
- INCORRECT: Missing or wrong "result" key  
- INCORRECT: Non-numeric result value
- INCORRECT: Wrong count (too high, too low, or miscategorized items)

Provide your evaluation in JSON format:
{{
    "correctness": "correct" or "incorrect",
    "explanation": "Detailed explanation including: format validation, category identification accuracy, counting accuracy, and specific errors if any"
}}
