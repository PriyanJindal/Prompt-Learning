Big Bench Hard Data: Web of Lies
Initial metric: 0.280
Final test accuracy: 0.400
Final prompt: 
You are an expert in solving truthfulness puzzles. Carefully analyze the statements and determine the truthfulness of the final statement. Return your answer **in JSON** with a single key `result` whose value is either "Yes" or "No". Follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial truth-teller or liar from the given statement.
2. Deduce the truthfulness of each subsequent statement based on the initial condition.
3. Ensure logical consistency throughout the analysis.
4. Provide the final answer based on the logical deduction.

To help you understand the process, here are a few examples:

Example 1:
- Initial statement: "Sima lies."
- Analysis: 
  - Sima is a LIAR.
  - Maybelle says Sima tells the truth, so Maybelle is a LIAR.
  - Audrie says Maybelle lies, which is true, so Audrie is a TRUTH-TELLER.
  - Leda says Audrie tells the truth, which is true, so Leda is a TRUTH-TELLER.
  - Shaunda says Leda lies, which is false, so Shaunda is a LIAR.
- Final answer: Shaunda does not tell the truth, so the result is "No".

Example 2:
- Initial statement: "Jim lies."
- Analysis:
  - Jim is a LIAR.
  - Yoland says Jim lies, which is true, so Yoland is a TRUTH-TELLER.
  - Willian says Yoland tells the truth, which is true, so Willian is a TRUTH-TELLER.
  - Delbert says Willian lies, which is false, so Delbert is a LIAR.
  - Shalonda says Delbert tells the truth, which is false, so Shalonda is a LIAR.
- Final answer: Shalonda does not tell the truth, so the result is "No".

Example 3:
- Initial statement: "Jamey tells the truth."
- Analysis:
  - Jamey is a TRUTH-TELLER.
  - Michael says Jamey lies, which is false, so Michael is a LIAR.
  - Sherrie says Michael lies, which is true, so Sherrie is a TRUTH-TELLER.
  - Bernita says Sherrie lies, which is false, so Bernita is a LIAR.
  - Amberly says Bernita tells the truth, which is false, so Amberly is a LIAR.
- Final answer: Amberly does not tell the truth, so the result is "No".

Example 4:
- Initial statement: "Phoebe lies."
- Analysis:
  - Phoebe is a LIAR.
  - Lorine says Phoebe tells the truth, which is false, so Lorine is a LIAR.
  - Dallas says Lorine lies, which is true, so Dallas is a TRUTH-TELLER.
  - Alexis says Dallas lies, which is false, so Alexis is a LIAR.
  - Jim says Alexis tells the truth, which is false, so Jim is a LIAR.
- Final answer: Jim does not tell the truth, so the result is "No".

Big Bench Hard Data: Boolean Expressions
Initial metric: 0.700
Final test accuracy: 0.720
Final prompt: 
You are tasked with solving boolean expressions. Please evaluate the expression and return your answer **in JSON** format with a single key `result` whose value is either "True" or "False". 

Here are some guidelines to help you evaluate the expressions correctly:
1. Apply the NOT operation first, followed by AND, and then OR.
2. Remember that "NOT NOT A" simplifies to "A".
3. "A AND NOT A" is always "False".
4. "A OR True" is always "True".
5. "A AND False" is always "False".
6. Evaluate expressions inside parentheses first, following the order of operations.

Examples to guide you:

Example 1:
Expression: not True or False and True
Evaluation: 
- NOT True is False
- False AND True is False
- False OR False is False
Result: {"result": "False"}

Example 2:
Expression: True and not False or False
Evaluation:
- NOT False is True
- True AND True is True
- True OR False is True
Result: {"result": "True"}

Example 3:
Expression: ( not not not True and True )
Evaluation:
- NOT NOT NOT True is False
- False AND True is False
Result: {"result": "False"}

Example 4:
Expression: not not False or False and not True
Evaluation:
- NOT NOT False is False
- NOT True is False
- False AND False is False
- False OR False is False
Result: {"result": "False"}

Big Bench Hard Data: Word Sorting
Initial metric: 0.720
Final test accuracy: 0.740
Final prompt: 
You are an expert in sorting words alphabetically. Your task is to sort a list of words in strict alphabetical order according to standard dictionary rules. Return your answer **in JSON** format with a single key `result`, whose value is the alphabetically sorted list of words separated by spaces. Ensure that all words from the input list are present exactly once in the output, with no additional words. Consider special characters and punctuation as part of the words when sorting. Here is your task: {input}

Examples for reference:

Example 1:
Input: List: sioux fortescue purloin percept helmsman
Output: "result": "fortescue helmsman percept purloin sioux"

Example 2:
Input: List: emission upon labour whim fairfax ride crepe prig accomplice az doff clatter circumcircle tea wheelbase pleura incantation choral viaduct lorry
Output: "result": "accomplice az choral circumcircle clatter crepe doff emission fairfax incantation labour lorry pleura prig ride tea upon viaduct wheelbase whim"

Example 3:
Input: List: griffith common nanosecond loosestrife decoy swabby aerospace denmark yates frill spitz enviable screechy allure sow spermatozoa saute jibe exclusive
Output: "result": "aerospace allure common decoy denmark enviable exclusive frill griffith jibe loosestrife nanosecond saute screechy sow spitz spermatozoa swabby yates"

Example 4:
Input: List: plural dose allstate stalin dyad multitudinous powderpuff
Output: "result": "allstate dose dyad multitudinous powderpuff plural stalin"

Ensure that your output strictly follows the alphabetical order and includes all input words exactly once. Pay special attention to the placement of words with special characters and punctuation, as they should be considered part of the word when sorting.
