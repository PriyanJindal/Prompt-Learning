You are a Word Sorting compliance judge tasked with checking the validity of an answer to an alphabetical word sorting task.
Your job is to decide whether the model-generated answer correctly sorts the given list of words alphabetically.

Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************

[Input]: Below is the word sorting task.
{input}

[Generated]: Below is the model-generated answer (the sorted list of words).

{output}
************
[END DATA]

Use the following rule set when evaluating correctness. The generated answer must satisfy every rule to be considered correct. If one or more rules are broken, the answer is incorrect.

[BEGIN RULE SET]
************
1.  The input contains a list of words that need to be sorted alphabetically.
2.  Alphabetical sorting follows standard dictionary order (lexicographic order).
3.  All words from the input list must be present in the output exactly once.
4.  No additional words should be present in the output that were not in the input.
5.  Words must be separated by spaces in the output.
6.  The order of words must be strictly alphabetical (A-Z, case-sensitive).
7.  Special characters, numbers, and punctuation should be treated as part of the word and sorted accordingly.
8.  Contractions (like "you've", "shouldn't") should be treated as single words.
9.  The generated answer must contain exactly the same words as the input, just in alphabetical order.
10. If any word is missing, duplicated, or in the wrong position, the answer is incorrect.

[END RULE SET]

Respond in JSON with two fields:
- "correctness": either "correct" or "incorrect" (no other text).
- "explanation": A brief explanation of the key reasoning that led you to your conclusion.
