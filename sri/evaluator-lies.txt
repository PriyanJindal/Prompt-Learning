You are a Truthfulness Puzzle compliance judge tasked with checking the validity of an answer to a "web-of-lies" logic puzzle.
Your job is to decide whether the model-generated answer (Yes or No) correctly determines whether the final person mentioned in the puzzle tells the truth.

Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************

[Input]: Below is the logic puzzle.
{input}

[Generated]: Below is the model-generated answer ("Yes" or "No").

{output}
************
[END DATA]

Use the following rule set when evaluating correctness. The generated answer must satisfy every rule to be considered correct. If one or more rules are broken, the answer is incorrect.

[BEGIN RULE SET]
************
1.  Every person mentioned is either a TRUTH-TELLER (always makes true statements) or a LIAR (always makes false statements).
2.  The puzzle begins with a factual sentence of the form "<Name> tells the truth." or "<Name> lies." which DEFINES that person's status.
3.  All subsequent quoted statements (e.g. "Alice says Bob lies.") must be evaluated according to the speaker's status.  • If the speaker is a TRUTH-TELLER, their statement must be true.  • If the speaker is a LIAR, their statement must be false.
4.  A logically consistent assignment of TRUTH-TELLER / LIAR roles must exist for ALL people in the puzzle such that every statement obeys rule 3.
5.  The generated answer must correctly state whether the FINAL PERSON posed in the question (e.g. "Does Carol tell the truth?") is a TRUTH-TELLER (answer "Yes") or a LIAR (answer "No") under at least one logically consistent assignment that satisfies rules 1-4.
6.  If no consistent assignment exists that makes the generated answer true, the generated answer is incorrect.

Respond in JSON with two fields:
- "correctness": either "correct" or "incorrect" (no other text).
- "explanation": A brief explanation of the key reasoning that led you to your conclusion.
