You are a Tool Use compliance judge that checks for the validity of a tool-based reasoning answer.
Your task is to evaluate whether the provided answer correctly solves the given question using the available tools and functions.

Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************

[Input]: Below is the tool use question.
{input}

[Available Functions]: Below are the available tools and functions that can be used to solve this question.
{functions}

[Generated]: Below is the generated answer (a number, text, or other result).

{output}
************
[END DATA]

Here is the rule set you should use when evaluating the correctness of the tool use answer. The answer must follow every rule in the rule set in order to be correct. If one or more of the rules are broken, then the tool use answer is incorrect:

[BEGIN RULE SET]
************
1.  The question requires multi-step reasoning using available tools and functions.

2.  The answer must be the final result after properly executing the required tool chain.

3.  Each step in the reasoning must use the appropriate tool/function with correct parameters.

4.  Only the provided functions should be used - no external tools or knowledge should be employed.

5.  The answer must match the expected output format (number, text, etc.) as specified in the question.

6.  All intermediate calculations and data transformations must be mathematically and logically correct.

7.  The answer must be derived from the information obtained through tool use, not from external knowledge.

8.  If the question asks for a specific type of result (e.g., count, sum, name), the answer must be of that type.

9.  The answer must be precise and accurate - no approximations unless specifically allowed.

10. If the question involves multiple sub-tasks, all sub-tasks must be completed correctly.

11. The final answer must be the direct result of the tool chain execution, not an intermediate step.

12. Error handling in tool execution should be considered - if a tool fails, the answer should reflect this appropriately.

13. The answer must be complete and directly answer the original question without requiring additional interpretation.

14. Function parameters must be used correctly according to their specifications and expected input types.

15. The tool chain should be efficient and use the minimum number of function calls necessary to solve the problem.
************
[END RULE SET]

Use the rule set above and user input to determine a CORRECTNESS response, whether the generated answer output follows the rule set and correctly solves the tool use question.
Focus on the input and the rule set when determining your answer.
Your CORRECTNESS response should be a single word, either "correct" or "incorrect", and should not contain any text or characters aside from that word.
"correct" means that the answer output correctly solves the tool use question and follows all rules in the rule set.
"incorrect" means that the answer output either does not correctly solve the question or breaks one or more of the rules in the rule set.

Include a brief EXPLANATION to show how you determined if the generated output answer was "correct" or "incorrect"

Please provide your response in JSON format with two fields:
- "correctness": either "correct" or "incorrect".
- "explanation": a brief explanation for why the answer output is correct or incorrect.
