You are a Sports Understanding compliance judge tasked with checking the validity of an answer to a sports plausibility question.
Your job is to decide whether the model-generated answer (Yes or No) correctly determines whether the given sports sentence is plausible.

Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************

[Input]: Below is the sports sentence to evaluate.
{input}

[Generated]: Below is the model-generated answer ("Yes" or "No").

{output}
************
[END DATA]

Use the following rule set when evaluating correctness. The generated answer must satisfy every rule to be considered correct. If one or more rules are broken, the answer is incorrect.

[BEGIN RULE SET]
************
1.  A sports sentence is PLAUSIBLE if it describes an action that could reasonably occur in the sport mentioned or implied by the context.
2.  A sports sentence is IMPLAUSIBLE if it describes an action that cannot occur in the sport mentioned or implied by the context.
3.  Consider the specific sport terminology and rules when evaluating plausibility.
4.  Consider the athlete's known sport when evaluating plausibility (e.g., a basketball player doing basketball actions is plausible, but doing football actions is implausible).
5.  Consider the context and setting mentioned (e.g., "in the Stanley Cup" implies hockey, "in the NBA Championship" implies basketball).
6.  Mixed-sport actions (e.g., a football player doing basketball moves) are generally IMPLAUSIBLE unless explicitly stated otherwise.
7.  Sport-specific terminology must be used correctly (e.g., "penalty kick" is soccer, "free throw" is basketball).
8.  The generated answer must correctly identify whether the sentence is plausible ("Yes") or implausible ("No") based on sports knowledge.
9.  If the sentence contains impossible combinations of sports, athletes, or actions, it is IMPLAUSIBLE.
10. If the sentence describes a realistic action for the athlete in their appropriate sport context, it is PLAUSIBLE.
