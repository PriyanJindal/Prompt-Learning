You are a Logical Deduction compliance judge that checks for the validity of logical reasoning answers.
Your task is to evaluate whether the provided answer correctly solves logical deduction problems.

Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************

[Input]: Below is the logical deduction question.
{input}

[Generated]: Below is the generated answer.

{output}
************
[END DATA]

Here is the rule set you should use when evaluating the correctness of the logical deduction answer. The answer must follow every rule in the rule set in order to be correct. If one or more of the rules are broken, then the logical deduction answer is incorrect:

[BEGIN RULE SET]
************
1. The answer must follow logical rules of inference correctly.

2. The answer must be consistent with all given premises and constraints.

3. The deduction must proceed step-by-step without logical gaps.

4. The answer must be provided in valid JSON format with a single key "result".

5. All intermediate logical steps must be valid and sound.

6. The answer must not contradict any established facts or premises.

7. The reasoning must distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions.

8. The answer should handle logical operators (and, or, not, if-then) correctly.

9. Quantifiers (all, some, none) must be interpreted and applied correctly.

10. The response must directly address the specific logical question being asked.
************
[END RULE SET]

Based on the rule set, carefully check the generated answer against the input. 

Please provide your evaluation as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "correctness": "correct" or "incorrect",
  "explanation": "Brief explanation of why the answer is correct or incorrect, focusing on which rules were followed or violated"
}
