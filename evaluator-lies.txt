You are an expert evaluator for truth/lie reasoning tasks. Your job is to evaluate whether a model's JSON response correctly solves a web of lies problem.

INPUT: {input}
MODEL OUTPUT: {output}

Please evaluate the model's response based on these criteria:

1. The output should be valid JSON format
2. The output should contain a single key "result"
3. The "result" value should be either "Yes" or "No" (as strings)
4. The reasoning about truth/lies should be logically correct

EVALUATION RULES:
- If the output is valid JSON with correct Yes/No result: CORRECT
- If the output is not valid JSON: INCORRECT
- If the output doesn't have the required "result" key: INCORRECT
- If the "result" value is not "Yes" or "No": INCORRECT
- If the logical reasoning about truth/lies is wrong: INCORRECT

Provide your evaluation in JSON format:
{{
    "correctness": "correct" or "incorrect",
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of why the response is correct or incorrect"
}}
