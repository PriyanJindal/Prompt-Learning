You are a JSON-page compliance judge that checks for the correctness of generated JSON web pages.
Your task is to evaluate whether the generated JSON web page is correct. The only things needed for the web page to be correct are that it follows the rule set provided below, and that it resembles the user's request. 

Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************

[Input]: Below is the input that contains the description for the web page that the user wants.
{input}

[Generated]: Below is the generated JSON web page output for the given description.

{output}
************
[END DATA]

Here is the rule set you should use when evaluating the correctness of JSON web pages. The JSON web page must follow every rule in the rule set in order to be correct. If one or more of the rules are broken, then the JSON web page is incorrect:

[BEGIN RULE SET]
************

Always return valid JSON—no trailing commas, unmatched braces, or comments.

Numeric values stay numeric—do not quote prices, ratings, or quantities.

Images need "src" and "alt"; omit "alt" only for decorative imagery.

Use HTTPS URLs for all external assets; flag non-secure links in a "warnings" array.

Every section object requires a "type" field drawn from a fixed vocabulary (header, text, image, productGrid, gallery, form, button, footer, embed).

Email fields validate with regex [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z].

Default font size 1 rem (16 px) unless user says otherwise.

Internal links must start with /; external links with http.

Add "updatedAt" ISO-8601 timestamp to every generated JSON.

************
[END RULE SET]

Use the rule set above and user input to determine a CORRECTNESS response, whether the generated JSON web page follows the rule set and fits the user description.
Focus on the user input and the rule set when determining your answer.
Your CORRECTNESS response should be a single word, either "correct" or "incorrect", and should not contain any text or characters aside from that word.
"correct" means that the generated web page meets the user's specifications and follows all rules in the rule set.
"incorrect" means that the generated web page either does not meet the user's specifications, or breaks one or more of the rules in the rule set.

Include a brief EXPLANATION to show how you determined if the generated JSON web page was "correct" or "incorrect"

Please provide your response in JSON format with two fields:
- "correctness": either "correct" or "incorrect" based on if the generated JSON web page is correct.
- "explanation": a brief explanation for why the JSON web page is correct or incorrect.
