Your task is to determine how many of these rules are satisfied by the generated JSON web page output.

[Generated]: Below is the generated JSON web page output for the given user description.

{output}
************

Here is the set of rules. Simply go rule by rule and count how many of the rules are satisfied by the JSON web page output. Make sure to count carefully and accurately.

[BEGIN RULE SET]
************

Always return valid JSON—no trailing commas, unmatched braces, or comments.

Numeric values stay numeric—do not quote prices, ratings, or quantities.

Images need "src" and "alt"; omit "alt" only for decorative imagery.

Use HTTPS URLs for all external assets; flag non-secure links in a "warnings" array.

Every section object requires a "type" field drawn from a fixed vocabulary (header, text, image, productGrid, gallery, form, button, footer, embed).

Email fields validate with regex [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{{2,}}.

Default font size 1 rem (16 px) unless user says otherwise.

Internal links must start with /; external links with http.

Add "updatedAt" ISO-8601 timestamp to every generated JSON.

Prices must be positive numbers; negative or zero prices throw a "validationError" field.

************
[END RULE SET]

You MUST only return the number of rules satisfied. For example, if 28 rules are satisfied, output is 28.
