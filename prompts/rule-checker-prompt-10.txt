You are a JSON-page rule checker. Your task is to determine which rules are broken in a JSON web page. 

Here is the data:
[BEGIN DATA]
************

[Generated]: Below is the JSON web page.

{output}
************
[END DATA]

Here are the rules that the JSON web page must follow. You need to pick the rules that are broken, and give all of them in their full text form. 

[BEGIN RULE SET]
************

Always return valid JSON—no trailing commas, unmatched braces, or comments.

Numeric values stay numeric—do not quote prices, ratings, or quantities.

Images need "src" and "alt"; omit "alt" only for decorative imagery.

Use HTTPS URLs for all external assets; flag non-secure links in a "warnings" array.

Every section object requires a "type" field drawn from a fixed vocabulary (header, text, image, productGrid, gallery, form, button, footer, embed).

Email fields validate with regex [A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z].

Default font size 1 rem (16 px) unless user says otherwise.

Internal links must start with /; external links with http.

Add "updatedAt" ISO-8601 timestamp to every generated JSON.

************
[END RULE SET]

Please include every rule that was broken in the JSON web page, and give the full text of the rules that were broken.

Please provide your response in JSON format with one field:
- "explanation": the list of the rules that were broken.
