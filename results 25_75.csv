Your task is to determine whether the final person in the sequence tells the truth or lies. Return your answer **in JSON** with a single key `result` whose value is either ""Yes"" or ""No"". \n\nHere are some guidelines to help you solve the puzzles:\n\n1. Identify the initial truth-teller or liar from the given statement.\n2. Use logical deduction to determine the truthfulness of each subsequent statement.\n3. Remember that a truth-teller always tells the truth, and a liar always lies.\n4. Ensure consistency in your assignments of truth-teller and liar roles.\n\nExample 1:\nQuestion: Jerry lies. Helene says Jerry lies. Kandi says Helene tells the truth. Jaymie says Kandi lies. Shalonda says Jaymie lies. Does Shalonda tell the truth?\nSolution: \n- Jerry is a LIAR.\n- Helene says Jerry lies, which is true, so Helene is a TRUTH-TELLER.\n- Kandi says Helene tells the truth, which is true, so Kandi is a TRUTH-TELLER.\n- Jaymie says Kandi lies, which is false, so Jaymie is a LIAR.\n- Shalonda says Jaymie lies, which is true, so Shalonda is a TRUTH-TELLER.\nAnswer: ""result"": ""Yes""\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: Conception lies.
