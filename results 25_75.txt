Big Bench Hard Data: Web of Lies

Initial metric: 0.320
Final test accuracy: 0.600
Final prompt: 
You are an expert in solving truthfulness puzzles. Your task is to determine whether the final person in the sequence tells the truth or lies. Return your answer **in JSON** with a single key `result` whose value is either "Yes" or "No". 

Here are some guidelines to help you solve the puzzles:

1. Identify the initial truth-teller or liar from the given statement.
2. Use logical deduction to determine the truthfulness of each subsequent statement.
3. Remember that a truth-teller always tells the truth, and a liar always lies.
4. Ensure consistency in your assignments of truth-teller and liar roles.
5. Double-check your deductions to ensure they align with the initial conditions and logical consistency.

Example 1:
Question: Jerry lies. Helene says Jerry lies. Kandi says Helene tells the truth. Jaymie says Kandi lies. Shalonda says Jaymie lies. Does Shalonda tell the truth?
Solution: 
- Jerry is a LIAR.
- Helene says Jerry lies, which is true, so Helene is a TRUTH-TELLER.
- Kandi says Helene tells the truth, which is true, so Kandi is a TRUTH-TELLER.
- Jaymie says Kandi lies, which is false, so Jaymie is a LIAR.
- Shalonda says Jaymie lies, which is true, so Shalonda is a TRUTH-TELLER.
Answer: "result": "Yes"

Example 2:
Question: Conception lies. Rashida says Conception tells the truth. Alejandro says Rashida tells the truth. Sherrie says Alejandro lies. Amberly says Sherrie tells the truth. Does Amberly tell the truth?
Solution:
- Conception is a LIAR.
- Rashida says Conception tells the truth, which is false, so Rashida is a LIAR.
- Alejandro says Rashida tells the truth, which is false, so Alejandro is a LIAR.
- Sherrie says Alejandro lies, which is true, so Sherrie is a TRUTH-TELLER.
- Amberly says Sherrie tells the truth, which is true, so Amberly is a TRUTH-TELLER.
Answer: "result": "No"

Example 3:
Question: Rashida lies. Fletcher says Rashida lies. Antwan says Fletcher lies. Willian says Antwan tells the truth. Vina says Willian tells the truth. Does Vina tell the truth?
Solution:
- Rashida is a LIAR.
- Fletcher says Rashida lies, which is true, so Fletcher is a TRUTH-TELLER.
- Antwan says Fletcher lies, which is false, so Antwan is a LIAR.
- Willian says Antwan tells the truth, which is false, so Willian is a LIAR.
- Vina says Willian tells the truth, which is false, so Vina is a LIAR.
Answer: "result": "No"

Big Bench Hard Data: Boolean Expressions

Initial metric: 0.693
Final test accuracy: 0.733
Final prompt: 
You are an expert in solving boolean expressions. Carefully evaluate the expression and return your answer **in JSON** with a single key `result` whose value is either "True" or "False". Ensure to follow the standard precedence rules: NOT is evaluated first, followed by AND, and then OR. 

Here are some examples to guide you:

1. Expression: `not True or True and False or False`
   - Evaluation: 'not True' is False, then 'False or True and False or False' is evaluated. 'True and False' is False, so the expression becomes 'False or False or False', which simplifies to False.
   - Result: `"result": "False"`

2. Expression: `not (True or True) and False`
   - Evaluation: 'True or True' is True, so 'not (True or True)' becomes 'not True', which is False. Then, 'False and False' is evaluated, which is False.
   - Result: `"result": "False"`

3. Expression: `False or not True and not not False`
   - Evaluation: 'not True' is False, 'not not False' is True, so the expression becomes 'False or False and True'. 'False and True' is False, and 'False or False' is False.
   - Result: `"result": "False"`

4. Expression: `False and not (True) or True`
   - Evaluation: 'not (True)' becomes False, so the expression simplifies to 'False and False or True'. 'False and False' is False, and 'False or True' is True.
   - Result: `"result": "True"`

5. Expression: `not not not (True and False)`
   - Evaluation: 'True and False' is False, then 'not (False)' is True, 'not not (True)' is True, and finally 'not (True)' is False.
   - Result: `"result": "False"`

Please ensure to provide a detailed step-by-step evaluation of the expression to validate the correctness of your result. This is your task: {input}

Big Bench Hard Data: Word Sorting

Initial metric: 0.800
Final test accuracy: 0.813
Final prompt: 
You are an expert in sorting words alphabetically. Your task is to return the alphabetically sorted list of words from the given input.

1. Include all words from the input list exactly once.
2. Sort the words in strict alphabetical order according to standard dictionary rules.
3. Ensure no additional words are included in the output.

Here is your task: {input}

Examples for reference:

Example 1:
Input: List: apple banana cherry
Output: 
```json
{
  "result": "apple banana cherry"
}
```

Output: 
```json
{
  "result": "cat dog elephant"
}
```

Example 4:
Input: List: nascent muddy
Output: 
```json
{
  "result": "muddy nascent"
}
```

Example 5:
Input: List: plural dose allstate stalin dyad multitudinous powderpuff
Output: 
```json
{
  "result": "allstate dose dyad multitudinous powderpuff plural stalin"
}
```

Ensure that your output strictly follows the format and guidelines provided. Double-check the alphabetical order to avoid any mistakes.
