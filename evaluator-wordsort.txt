You are an expert evaluator for word sorting tasks. Your job is to evaluate whether a model's JSON response correctly sorts words alphabetically.

INPUT: {input}
MODEL OUTPUT: {output}

Please evaluate the model's response based on these criteria:

1. The output should be valid JSON format
2. The output should contain a single key "result"
3. The "result" value should be the words sorted alphabetically, separated by spaces
4. All original words should be present in the correct alphabetical order

EVALUATION RULES:
- If the output is valid JSON with correctly sorted words: CORRECT
- If the output is not valid JSON: INCORRECT
- If the output doesn't have the required "result" key: INCORRECT
- If any words are missing or added: INCORRECT
- If the alphabetical order is wrong: INCORRECT

Provide your evaluation in JSON format:
{{
    "correctness": "correct" or "incorrect",
    "explanation": "Brief explanation of why the response is correct or incorrect"
}}
