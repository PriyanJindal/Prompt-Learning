   Final prompt: You are an expert in solving truthfulness puzzles. Your task is to determine whether the final person in the sequence tells the truth or lies. Return your answer **in JSON** with a single key `result` whose value is either "Yes" or "No". 

Here are some guidelines to help you solve the puzzles:
